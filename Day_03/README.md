For Day 1 and Day 2 I tried to use basic Python without imports, 
mainly for practice but also because I'm a noob and I didn't want to go and learn 
how to use a bunch of packages. 

I managed to do this till Day 3 part 2, where I was stuck for 2 days...
I caved and looked up regex since I'd seen many people use it for this puzzle. 

Some documentation, for myself and other noobs attempting Advent of Code with very basic knowledge.
