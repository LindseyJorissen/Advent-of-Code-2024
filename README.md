# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„
Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This repo contains my solutions and progress for the Advent of Code challenges, as someone who started coding a few months ago. 

Advent of Code is an annual event where developers around the world solve coding puzzles every day throughout December, using their language of choice. Each day presents a new challenge, and I'll be trying to solve them using Python.
